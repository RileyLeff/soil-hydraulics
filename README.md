# soil-hydraulics üêÉ &emsp; ![Build Status] [![Codecov Badge]][Codecov Info] [![Apache Badge]][Apache Link] [![MIT Badge]][MIT Link]

Rust implementation of the soil hydraulic model described in
[Van Genuchten 1980](doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400050002x).

## Compatibility

Builds on no_std with the error_in_core feature. Has std support behind feature flags. Requires nightly rust, for now. I'm sure it's possible to conditionally compile on stable + std (i.e. when error_in_core is not active) but don't have time to figure that out right now. If you need that, feel free to contribute.

## Dev Dependencies

The pre-commit config relies on [casey/just: ü§ñ Just a command runner](https://github.com/casey/just)
